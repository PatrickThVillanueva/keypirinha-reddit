# NOTE TO PLUGIN DEVELOPER:
# * This file may be removed from the package if no plugin requires
#   configuration
# * The [main] section below is an example and not mandatory, however it is good
#   practice to keep the [var] and [env] sections, as well as their respective
#   comments
# * This comment block may be removed!

[main]
# Plugin's main configuration section

# Enable Not Safe For Work (NSFW) filter
# If nswf is set to False, the suggestions will not show posts which have been tagged as NSFW.
# Posts with the NSFW-tag could be pornographic, gore etc.
# Can take the values "True" and "False", without quotes
# Default is False
# show_nswf = False

# Fast loading, disables subreddit icons inorder to load results faster. 
# When fast_load is set to False, the suggestions will show subreddit icons
# Can take the values "True" and "False", without quotes
# Default is False
#fast_load = False

# Listing behaviour
# Lists posts in your favorite subreddits accordingly to the listing chosen.
# Can take one of these values: "Hot", "Rising", "New", "Best" - without quotes. Case insensitive
# Default is "Hot"
#listing = Hot

# List of favorite subreddits. When you list these, you will be able to see posts from them.
# Must start with "r/" without quotes. Examples:
# [r/Gaming]
# [r/memes]

[var]
# As in every Keypirinha's configuration file, you may optionally include a
# [var] section to declare variables that you want to reuse anywhere else in
# this file.
#
# Note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value defined
# in the main configuration file of the application (i.e.: "Keypirinha.ini") has
# already been made available to this file as well so you do not need to
# duplicate it here unless you want to override it.
#
# REMINDER: For convenience, Keypirinha silently populates this section with
# predefined values that may come handy. Here are some of them: APP_DIR,
# APP_EXE, PROFILE_DIR, PROFILE_DIR_INSTALLED_PACKS, PROFILE_DIR_LIVE_PACKS,
# PROFILE_DIR_USER and the KNOWNFOLDER_* and KNOWNFOLDERGUID_* values.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.


[env]
# For convenience, Keypirinha populates this [env] section in every loaded
# configuration file so you can easily access to environment variables like
# PATH for example from this file using syntax: ${env:PATH}
#
# If an environment variable happens to be changed while Keypirinha is running
# and this modification impacts current configuration, application and packages
# configuration will be reloaded if needed only.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.
